  <div><h2>1.Global Reach</h2></div>
  <div><p>Traditional marketing is restricted by geography and creating an international marketing campaign can be hard, expensive, as well as labor-intensive. However, digital marketing happens on the Internet, which means that the reach you can achieve with it is immense. Even a very small local business owner has the ability to reach an international audience with an online store. This would never be possible with traditional marketing or would cost a whole lot of money to do so. This online accessibility has opened many growth opportunities for businesses to explore. The combination of global reach and visibility is a great opportunity for any business.</p></div>
  <hr class="lines">

  <br>
  <br>
  <div><h2>2.Local Reach</h2></div>
  <div><p>While global reach is a significant advantage of digital marketing, it also improves local visibility, which is especially important if your business relies on nearby customers. Local SEO and locally targeted ads can be beneficial for companies trying to bring more customers to their doors. Think of the reach you can get to a whole neighborhood with digital marketing versus the reach it would take you to print out flyers and distribute them around.

  </p></div>
  <hr class="lines">

  <br>
  <br>
  <div><h2>3.Lower Cost</h2></div>
  <div><p>Whether you want to promote your business locally or internationally, digital marketing provides you with cost-effective solutions. It allows even the smallest companies to compete with larger companies using highly targeted strategies. Most of these strategies won’t even cost anything at all to start with (such as SEO, social media, and content marketing). However, not every form of digital marketing is suitable for every business and some may even have more costs than others. A business can find appropriate solutions based on its marketing goals.

  <div><h2>4.Easy To Learn</h2></div>
  <div><p>While there are many aspects of digital marketing that you need to learn, it is fairly easy to get started with. It gets more complex from the nature of the goals and the scale of the campaigns. However, it is all a matter of finding the right strategy that works for your business.

<br>
<br>
<div><h2>5.Increase Engagement</h2></div>
<div><p>One of the most important advantages of digital marketing is increased engagement. Digital marketing is designed to be highly engaging by default. Users can share a blog post, like a photo, save a video, or engage with your website via a paid ad click. The best part is that all of these actions can be measured. This enables you to create even more engaging posts to increase brand awareness or boost sales. The more you engage online, the more loyal customers you can get. Businesses that use engaging formats effectively in their online strategies have an easier time converting cold traffic to loyal customers.
